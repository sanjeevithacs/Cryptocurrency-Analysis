2.2 Literature Survey 

Cryptocurrency price prediction is an area of growing interest due to the volatile and 
unpredictable nature of digital currencies. The current system employs a simple yet effective 
Linear Regression model to predict the future closing prices of cryptocurrencies based on 
historical data. This approach leverages traditional machine learning techniques, which are 
widely used for financial forecasting, particularly for predicting stock prices and asset values. 
Linear Regression has been applied in various financial prediction tasks due to its 
simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. Research has shown that even basic models can 
provide competitive predictions when the right features are chosen. For instance, Sezer et al. 
(2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of regression models in stock price forecasting, 
highlighting their ability to model linear relationships between financial variables such as 
opening, closing, high, and low prices. These same features are used in the current system to 
predict the future closing price of cryptocurrencies, demonstrating the continued relevance of 
Linear Regression in this domain. 
One of the key advantages of Linear Regression is its ability to handle smaller datasets 
efficiently. Studies such as those by Shen et al. (2020) have found that for short-term financial 
predictions, Linear Regression can perform well, especially when the relationship between the 
input features (e.g., opening, closing, high, and low prices) and the target variable (next closing 
price) is linear. The system developed here captures these relationships and makes predictions 
based on historical price data retrieved from the Binance API, with a focus on simplicity and ease 
of use. 
In addition, the system evaluates model performance using widely accepted metrics such 
as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score. These metrics provide clear insights into the 
model's accuracy and are often used to assess the effectiveness of regression models in financial 
forecasting. For example, the R² Score gives a sense of how well the model's predictions match 
the actual data, while the MAE provides a direct measure of the average error in predictions. 
These evaluation metrics align with industry standards for assessing the performance of financial 
models, demonstrating the robustness of the approach. 
The integration of the Streamlit framework makes the system user-friendly, allowing users 
to interact with the model easily and visualize predictions in real time. This simplicity is an 
advantage, particularly for those seeking to quickly assess cryptocurrency price trends without 
the need for complex configurations or deep technical knowledge. The ease of use, combined 
with the transparency of the Linear Regression model, makes this system accessible for both 
novice and experienced users alike. 
In conclusion, the use of Linear Regression for cryptocurrency price prediction offers a 
practical, efficient, and interpretable approach to forecasting. By focusing on well-chosen 
features like historical price data, the system provides valuable insights into the trends of 
cryptocurrency markets. This method offers an accessible alternative to more complex models, 
demonstrating that even traditional machine learning techniques can offer meaningful predictions 
in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.
